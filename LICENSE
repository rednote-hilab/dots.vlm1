dots.vlm1 LICENSE AGREEMENT

Effective Date: [August 16, 2025]

Copyright Holder: [Xingyin Information Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd]

This License Agreement (“Agreement”) governs Your use, reproduction, modification, and distribution of dots.vlm1 (the "Model Materials"). This Agreement is designed to maximize the openness and use of the Model Materials while addressing the unique legal, ethical, and technical challenges posed by visual-language models.

WHEREAS, Licensor has developed the dots.vlm1 visual-Language Models and intends to distribute the Model Materials under an open‑source framework;
WHEREAS, traditional open-source licenses (e.g., the MIT License) may not fully address the complexities of Visual-Language Models, namely their multiple components (code, weights, training data), potential ethical risks, data‑governance issues, and intellectual‑property and liability questions regarding AI‑generated content;
WHEREAS, Licensor seeks to provide a legal framework that ensures maximum access to and use of the Model Materials while clearly defining the rights, obligations, and liabilities of Licensee;

THEREFORE, the parties agree that, subject to the MIT License, they shall be bound by the following terms and conditions:

1. Definitions and Interpretation
Purpose: To define key terms used in this Agreement, particularly "Model Materials," ensuring clarity of the license scope beyond traditional software code. To clarify the order of precedence between this Agreement and the MIT License to avoid conflict.

1.1 “Licensor” shall mean the entity providing the Model Materials under this Agreement, namely [Xingyin Information Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd].

1.2 “Licensee” or "You" shall mean any individual or entity exercising permissions granted by this Agreement.

1.3 “Model Materials” shall mean all materials provided by Licensor under this Agreement, including but not limited to:
        (a) one or more machine‑learning models, including architecture and trained parameters (i.e., model weights);
        (b) all associated preprocessing, training, inference, and fine‑tuning code;
        (c) training datasets and evaluation scripts (or their detailed descriptions and access mechanisms); and
        (d) any accompanying documentation, metadata, and tools.
The above Model Materials shall be subject to the content published on the Licensor’s website or GitHub repository at https://github.com/rednote-hilab/dots.vlm1.

1.4 “Outputs” shall mean any content generated through the use of the Model Materials, including but not limited to text descriptions, image labels, image-text matching results, etc.

1.6   Priority of Agreement. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and the MIT License, the terms of the MIT License shall prevail. However, if the terms of the MIT License are ambiguous or silent on a particular matter, the provisions of this Agreement shall apply and supplement the MIT License.

2. Grant of Rights and Scope of Use
Purpose: To grant broad, permissive rights to the Licensee for the Model Materials—including code, weights, data, and documentation—to ensure maximum openness and flexibility while clarifying the free use of model-generated content. Additionally, it clarifies the feasibility of transitioning from open-source to commercial‑use.

2.1   Grant of Copyright License. Subject to Licensee's compliance with this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants Licensee a perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive, no-charge, royalty‑free copyright license to use (run or test), reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, merge, publish, distribute the Model Materials copies of the Model Materials or any derivative works thereof; and incorporate the unmodified or modified Model Materials into proprietary products or services, including for commercial purposes.

2.2   Fundamental Capabilities. The Model Materials only provide the fundamental model’s capabilities. Licensees may develop derivative AI applications or undertake task‑specific training thereon.

2.3   From Open Source to Commercial Use. The open-source release does not preclude Licensor’s commercial exploitation of the Model Materials, in whole or in part. Any such commercial use shall, at that time, be subject to license agreements between Licensor and applicable users.

3. Acceptable Use Policy and Prohibited Uses

3.1   Responsible Use. Licensee must use the Model Materials in a responsible, ethical, and lawful manner, in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, industry standards, and best practices.

3.2   Enterprise On‑Premises Deployment. The Licensee may deploy the Model Materials in closed‑source, on‑premises enterprise environments.

3.3   Prohibited Uses. Any breach of the prohibitions below will result in the automatic termination of all licenses granted under this Agreement. Licensee agrees not to use the Model Materials or any derivative works thereof, in connection with:
(a) Prohibition of Illegal Content Identification and Description: It is strictly prohibited to use image recognition technology to analyze images of fraudulent or forged documents, tickets, seals, etc., and generate text descriptions that make them appear legitimate or actionable (e.g., outputting misleading conclusions such as "the anti-counterfeit features of this ticket are intact"). It is also prohibited to generate technical guidance, beautification, or censorship-evading text descriptions for images related to violent crimes, child exploitation, or terrorist activities.
(b) Prohibition of Privacy Invasion and Discrimination: Without legal authorization and explicit consent from the concerned parties, image recognition must not be used to extract personal biometric features (such as facial features, fingerprints), identification numbers, medical records, or sensitive location information, and output full details (e.g., "the person in the image resides at XX street") or associative conclusions (e.g., "this face matches a wanted criminal in the database"). It is also prohibited to generate text reports for automated discriminatory decisions based on characteristics like race or gender observed in images (e.g., "Based on clothing, credit rating is likely low").
(c) Prohibition of Undermining Information Authenticity and Social Trust: It is strictly forbidden to generate text descriptions that cover up traces of image forgery. It is also prohibited to generate inflammatory text labels for violent or insulting images (e.g., describing a fight image as "just punishment"). In news, judicial, or similar fields, it is prohibited to output definitive conclusions without factual basis for suspicious images.
(d) Prohibition of Intellectual Property Infringement: It is prohibited to generate text descriptions that assist in the distribution of infringing images (e.g., "highly detailed reproduction of artwork techniques") for uploaded infringing images.

4. Intellectual Property Ownership and Contributions
4.1   Licensor's Copyright Reservation. Licensor reserves all right, title, and interest in and to the Model Materials (including the model architecture, parameters, code, and original training data), except as expressly licensed herein. The original copyright of the Model Materials belongs to the Licensor.

4.2   Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants Licensee a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Model Materials, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by the Licensor that are necessarily infringed by its contribution(s). 
If Licensee institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Model Materials constitute direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted under this License for the Model Materials shall terminate as of the date such litigation is asserted or filed.

4.3   Outputs. The intellectual property rights and related rights of any images uploaded by the user always remain with the original rights holder. This agreement does not transfer or grant any rights or licenses in this regard. The text output generated by the model is a machine interpretation of the input image (including object recognition, scene analysis, attribute description, etc.). As it is essentially an automated expression of objective facts, it does not constitute an original work protected by copyright law and therefore does not create new intellectual property ownership issues. The licensee and end users are free to use such descriptive text.
The licensor makes no guarantees regarding whether the output text infringes third-party rights (including copyrights, privacy, trademarks). The licensee should independently assess legal risks, especially when user-uploaded content contains material with a high potential for infringement (e.g., movie screenshots, artwork).
4.4   Trademarks. Nothing in this License permits Licensee to make use of Licensor’s trademarks, trade names, logos (e.g., “rednote,” “Xiaohongshu,” “dots.vlm1”“hilab”) or to otherwise suggest endorsement or misrepresent the relationship between the parties, unless Licensor’s prior written approval is granted.

5. Data Governance, Privacy, and Security
5.1   Training‑Data Usage. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that user inputs and Outputs, may be used by the Licensor in further training, to improve the Model Materials and enhance user experience. Licensor assumes no confidentiality obligation with respect to such data.

5.2   Data Quality and Bias. Licensee shall use training data from lawful sources and is encouraged to conduct due diligence before deploying the Model Materials and to take reasonable steps to mitigate any known biases in its training data or applications.

5.3   Privacy Protection.
        (a) Sensitive‑Data Restrictions. It is prohibited to use the Model Materials to process, generate, or infer sensitive personal data protected under specific laws (such as GDPR or HIPAA), particularly when dealing with documents containing personally identifiable information (such as ID numbers, health data, financial information, etc.), unless Licensee has obtained all necessary consents, lawful basis, or authorizations, and has implemented adequate anonymization, pseudonymization, or other privacy-enhancing technologies.
        (b) Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation. The Licensee shall follow the principle of data minimization when using the Visual-Language Model, processing only the user data necessary for specific, explicit, and lawful purposes. 
        (c) Transparency. Licensee shall provide clear and transparent privacy policies and terms of use when processing user data, clearly disclose that the images uploaded by the user will be analyzed (including objects, text, and biometric features) and generate text descriptions, ensuring that end users are informed about how their data is used, stored, and protected.

5.4   Security Measures. Licensee shall implement appropriate technical and administrative safeguards to protect the Model Materials and any associated data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, encryption, access controls, logging, and audit trails.
